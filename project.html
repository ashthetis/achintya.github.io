		<p>This was the first android application I published on the google play store and it taught me alot! You can find it by searching “Fitpal by Achintya” on the google playstore. Tasks I completed:</p>
		<p> 1) Created a simple layout and design for an android platform through Android Studio.</p>
		<p> 2) Used a MVC Software Design Pattern to architect the application and make different components reusable.</p>
		<p> 3) Bridged the data structure and the GUI for the final product.</p>
		<p> 4) Used User Inputted data to calculate the BMI and give them the results.</p>
		<p> 5) Compared the results with the average BMI readings in the area and gave the user a rough idea w here they stand with their fitness goals.

<p>This was a team project. I was in the backend team for the application and managed the storage of data such as username, passwords and other information. My tasks included: </p>

 <p> 1) Designing and managing the server end tasks.</p>
 <p> 2) Helped in making the PHP scripts for automation of emails to users.</p>
 <p> 3) Send data from the client side to the server using JSON and REST API</p>
 <p> 4) After finishing the backend tasks I also helped in making a structure for storing the data from the user end. I used a simple hashmap. I assigned every used a ID and assigned user data based on those ID's. This helped sort some simple information for users such as user emails.
